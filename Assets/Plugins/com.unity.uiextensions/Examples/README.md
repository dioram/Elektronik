## [How do I get set up?](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/GettingStarted)

Either clone / download this repository to your machine and then copy the scripts in, or use the pre-packaged .UnityPackage for your version of Unity and import it as a custom package in to your project.

## [Contribution guidelines](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/ContributionGuidelines)

Got a script you want added? Then just fork the bitbucket repository and submit a PR.  All contributions accepted (including fixes)

Just ensure:

* The header of the script should match the standard used in all scripts
* The script uses the **Unity.UI.Extensions** namespace so they do not affect any other developments
* (optional) Add Component and Editor options where possible (editor options are in the Editor\UIExtensionsMenuOptions.cs file)

## [License](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/License)

All scripts conform to the BSD3 license and are free to use / distribute.  See the [LICENSE](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/License) file for more information =
