Description: Tool for testing and debugging SLAM
 Elektronik is a tool that is actively used by the Dioram development team in developing tracking algorithms and SLAM. 
 This software allows you to visually track:                                              
  - changes in the point cloud;
  - changes in the connectivity graph of observations;
  - changes in a map constructed using the SLAM algorithm;
  - motion of tracked objects (for example, the track of a VR helmet and the reference track);
  - detected planes;
  - images from camera at the moment of time.
